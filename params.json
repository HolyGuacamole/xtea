{"name":"Xtea","tagline":"A python version of XTEA","body":"# Python XTEA\r\n\r\nThis is an XTEA-Cipher implementation in Python (eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm).\r\n\r\nXTEA is a blockcipher with 8 bytes blocksize and 16 bytes Keysize (128-Bit).\r\nThe algorithm is secure at 2014 with the recommend 64 rounds (32 cycles). This\r\nimplementation supports following modes of operation:\r\nECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR\r\nIt also supports CBC-MAC.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is [PEP-272](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0272/) compliant and is in the public domain.\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from xtea import *\r\n>>> key = \" \"*16  # Never use this key\r\n>>> text = \"This is a text. \"*8\r\n>>> x = new(key, mode=MODE_OFB, IV=\"12345678\")\r\n>>> c = x.encrypt(text)\r\n>>> text == x.decrypt(c)\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n    \r\n## Note\r\n\r\nI does NOT guarantee that this implementation (or the base cipher) is secure. If there are bugs, tell me them please.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
